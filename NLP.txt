Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and a subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to make computers understand human language. NLP uses computational linguistics, which is the study of how language works, and various models based on statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. These technologies allow computers to analyze and process text or voice data, and to grasp their full meaning, including the speaker’s or writer’s intentions and emotions.
NLP powers many applications that use language, such as text translation, voice recognition, text summarization, and chatbots. You may have used some of these applications yourself, such as voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text software, and customer service bots. NLP also helps businesses improve their efficiency, productivity, and performance by simplifying complex tasks that involve language.
NLP encompasses a wide array of techniques that aimed at enabling computers to process and understand human language. These tasks can be categorized into several broad areas, each addressing different aspects of language processing
One of the most irritating things about email is spam. Gmail uses natural language processing (NLP) to discern which emails are legitimate and which are spam. These spam filters look at the text in all the emails you receive and try to figure out what it means to see if it’s spam or not.
Algorithmic trading is used for predicting stock market conditions. Using NLP, this technology examines news headlines about companies and stocks and attempts to comprehend their meaning in order to determine if you should buy, sell, or hold certain stocks.
NLP can be seen in action by using Google Search or Siri Services. A major use of NLP is to make search engines understand the meaning of what we are asking and generate natural language in return to give us the answers.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, generate, and manipulate language in a way that is meaningful. NLP is at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and machine learning, and it plays a critical role in various applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more.
One of the primary challenges of NLP lies in understanding the complexities of human language. Language is ambiguous, context-dependent, and constantly evolving, making it difficult for machines to process and derive accurate meaning. Tasks like tokenization, parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) help break down and analyze language into understandable components. These tasks form the building blocks for more advanced applications.
Modern NLP relies heavily on machine learning and deep learning techniques. Traditional methods like bag-of-words and TF-IDF focus on statistical representations, but these have largely been replaced by advanced approaches like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, Glove) and transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT). These models leverage large datasets and neural networks to capture the nuances of language, including syntax, semantics, and context, enabling state-of-the-art performance in tasks like question answering, summarization, and text generation.
